**Abstract:** In recent years, Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models have become a go-to tool for counterfactual and policy analysis in central banks. In practice, overly-complex models are simplified to a more tractable version that can be solved with fast local methods, as the closed-form or even approximate solutions become infeasible due to the “dimensionality curse.” This simplification comes at the sacrifice of interesting features and loss of the empirical credibility of the model output. To address this problem, we develop a neural network algorithm for approximating and estimating the global solution in high-dimensional dynamic economic models. In our framework, the neural networks are efficiently trained using stochastic gradient descent to approximate policy and decision functions; moreover, the framework determines a foundation for a subsequent fast parameter estimation process as the neural network solves economic models for the whole parameter space.

We apply our algorithm to a simple consumption-saving problem with multiple shocks, a small-scale representative-agent New Keynesian DSGE model with monopolistic competition, and two HANK models with strong non-linearities and aggregate risks. The application of our framework has demonstrated that it can generate reliable and interpretable economic results for small-scale representative-agent models. However, it does not consistently produce accurate solution approximations for complex heterogeneous-agent models. To address the problem, our suggested solution involves utilising different sampling and simulation methods to increase the stability of the neural network solution.
